        <img src="tayloe.png" alt="Taylor Swift smiling">
        <p>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. A subject of widespread public interest with a vast fanbase, she has influenced the music industry, popular culture, and politics through her songwriting, artistry, entrepreneurship, and advocacy.
            Swift began professional songwriting at 14. She signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 and achieved prominence as a country pop singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). Their singles "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Love Story", and "You Belong with Me" were crossover successes on country and pop radio formats and brought Swift mainstream fame. She experimented with rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic styles on Red (2012); the latter featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together". Swift recalibrated her image from country to pop with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album containing the chart-topping songs "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-influenced Reputation (2017) and its number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do".

            <p>Just wanted to thank you again for a fantastic show. Everybody loved it, both adults and children alike. I had so many comments on how good you were, and I have to agree.
                Nothing was too much trouble for you, giving out prizes, photos, autographs etc after your set (Which again turned a good night into a sensational one) I will never forget the children’s faces when you came out.
